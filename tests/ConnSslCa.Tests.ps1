// The CA certificate path on a saved connection.

// This is a field that several separate code paths all have to remember to carry, which is the
// shape of bug that actually happens: one of them rebuilds the connection object from parts and
// quietly drops it. forgetPassword() did exactly that in the first draft of this feature - it
// reconstructs {host,port,user,ssl,password:''} and saves, so a connection whose password you
// removed would also have silently lost its CA and stopped connecting under "verify".
//
// So rather than test the happy path, these pin the wiring: every save carries it, every load
// restores it, and the one function that assembles the connection for the backend includes it.
